# plop-scripts by igeligel

Scripts, written in JavaScript, which will create several files for:
- [Java EE applications](/templates/javaee)

## Dependencies

npm:
- [plop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop)

I have not included plop as npm package here because you should install it globally to access other files also. For more instructions check out the [Installation](##Installation).

## Installation

You need to have plop installed. You can easily install this by npm. The easiest way to get npm is to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine. Otherwise you can also install a [standalone version of npm](https://github.com/npm/npm/releases).

After you have npm ready on your machine, make sure you have access to git and clone this repository. You can also download it via GitHub.

After downloading/cloning, open a new console and change the directory to the folder of the repository. It should look like this:

![Console Output](http://i.imgur.com/md9fEbY.png "Console Output")

If you can see the *package.json* file you have installed all requirements for this project.

After this you need to install [plop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop). To install it globally open your command line/console and type:
```
$ npm install -g plop
```

## How to use

Change the directory to the project where you can see the *package.json* file.

After you have done all steps of the [Installation](##Installation) you can type: 
```
$ npm run plop
```

After this you come up with this menu:

Now you can navigate with your arrow keys and decide the different options for creating templates.
